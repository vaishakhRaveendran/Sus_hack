Given the disruption of production conditions and the rising variability in yield caused by climate change.By proactively anticipating the influence of climate change on commodity yields, we can gain a deeper 
understanding of its effects on raw material prices, thereby ensuring sustainability and mitigating risks throughout the supply chains. Utilizing these models enables us to optimize procurement processes and implement effective pricing strategies for different commodities.Developing ML models that can forecast the effects of climate change on commodity prices.Predicting the cotton yields in different states of india. For the implementation and testing of model extensive works were done on sklearn pipelines. Feel free to check those out.
